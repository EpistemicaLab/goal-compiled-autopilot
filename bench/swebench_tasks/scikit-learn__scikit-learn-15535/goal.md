## Problem statement

regression in input validation of clustering metrics
```python
from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score
import numpy as np

x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)
mutual_info_score(x, x)
```
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'b'

while
```python
x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20)
mutual_info_score(x, x)
```
works with a warning?

this worked in 0.21.1 without a warning (as I think it should)


Edit by @ogrisel: I removed the `.astype(object)` in the second code snippet.


## Acceptance criterion (held out from agent)

The patch must pass the project's existing test suite *plus* the test_patch
that was withheld from the agent. Oracle runs the held-out test patch and
checks for a clean pass.
