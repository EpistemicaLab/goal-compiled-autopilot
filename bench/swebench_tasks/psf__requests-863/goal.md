# SWE-bench Lite task: psf__requests-863

**Repo:** psf/requests
**Base commit:** a0df2cbb10419037d11d04352b3175405ab52941

## Problem statement

Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument
Currently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().

This would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.



## Acceptance criterion (held out from agent)

The patch must pass the project's existing test suite *plus* the test_patch
that was withheld from the agent. Oracle runs the held-out test patch and
checks for a clean pass.
