## Problem statement

inaccurate rendering of pi**(1/E)
This claims to be version 1.5.dev; I just merged from the project master, so I hope this is current.  I didn't notice this bug among others in printing.pretty.

```
In [52]: pi**(1/E)                                                               
Out[52]: 
-1___
╲╱ π 

```
LaTeX and str not fooled:
```
In [53]: print(latex(pi**(1/E)))                                                 
\pi^{e^{-1}}

In [54]: str(pi**(1/E))                                                          
Out[54]: 'pi**exp(-1)'
```



## Acceptance criterion (held out from agent)

The patch must pass the project's existing test suite *plus* the test_patch
that was withheld from the agent. Oracle runs the held-out test patch and
checks for a clean pass.
